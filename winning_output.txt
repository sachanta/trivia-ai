GPT4 RESULT: Nvidia (NVDA) (0.91s)

SONAR_PRO RESULT: Palantir (PLTR) (2.71s)

SONAR RESULT: I don't have specific data on the percentage returns for Palantir (PLTR) and Nvidia (NVDA) from the start of 2024 to the end of 2024. However, based on the information available, AppLovin (APP) has shown significant growth and performance in 2024. Without specific data for the other stocks, it's difficult to definitively choose. However, if we consider AppLovin's strong financial performance and growth, it might be a strong contender. 

Given the lack of specific data for all options, I cannot accurately determine the correct answer without more information. (4.64s)
